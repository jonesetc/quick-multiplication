quick-multiplication
====================

A high level implementation of multiplication and division by shifts, adds, 
and subtracts. Done for my computer architecture course.

Notes on use:
============
- To make both versions of the program, run `make`.
- If you would like to use my timing script you will need python 2.X 
as well as the sh and numpy 3rd party libraries (pip install advised).
- To run timing script run `python timer.py`.
